<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Whether optativity is a grammaticalized phenomenon rather than one that arises from context is a question that is under consideration in current research. It is also the central topic that this article deals with. It argues for possible obligatory combinations of cues that lead to optativity. The principal focus lies on describing possibilities that aim to answer questions on the issue of grammaticalization, i.e. whether or not there are structures that force optativity.</p>

<p>The basic accounts of conditionals are portrayed. As this article is primarily interested in the availability of cues that form conditionals into optative conditionals, the main focus regarding conditionals is to semi-automatically determine features that are of interest for the current research.</p>
