# Intro

A place for me to structure things – that's the original purpose of this website. It helps me form thoughts, keep track of projects I enjoy, and push my limits by releasing own work to the public. In fact, I enjoy writing short stories and longer fiction in my spare time and the occasional piece does end up on here. By now, you may also find further information on me; and despite this being a rather vague call, I am happy to get in touch with anyone who has interesting things to share or discuss. Browse around and feel free to contact me.

Having said that – welcome to my website! Come closer and have a look.
